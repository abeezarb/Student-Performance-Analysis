# Student Performance Analysis
This project is a thorough and detailed analysis of student performance data, sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to determine which factors most influence academic outcomes and how schools can better allocate resources to improve test scores.

# Overview
This analysis explores how socioeconomic factors (like parental education, test preparation, and transport means) relate to student test scores across math, reading, and writing. The goal is to offer actionable insights to educational stakeholders through:

- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis  
- K-means clustering to group students by performance levels  
- Linear regression to identify key predictors of academic success  
- Visualizations to communicate patterns and disparities  
- Fairness analysis on model predictions

# Tools
- Language: Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
- Techniques: K-means Clustering, Linear Regression, Data Analysis
